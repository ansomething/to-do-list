Hello! This is another small project I've been working on to practice and also learn more stuff. It took me almost three days to do it since I was struggling with the layout and, of course, with the JavaScript. (I've done it with the help of MDN documentation, YouTube videos and articles!)

There's some features I would like to add in the future, like a calendar so you can add specific tasks to specific days, but right now I'm proud of the results.

If you're seeing this, thank you for your interest!
